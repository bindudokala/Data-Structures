üìå Main Idea of the N-Queens Problem:
The goal is to place N queens on an N*N chessboard such that:

No two queens attack each other.

Queens can move any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.


üìñ How It Works:

At each step:

‚Ä¢ Check each column in the current row r.

‚Ä¢ Use isSafe to see if placing a queen at position (r, c) would lead to a conflict with already-placed queens.

    ‚Ä¢ Check vertically upward.

    ‚Ä¢ Check diagonally upward to the left.

    ‚Ä¢ Check diagonally upward to the right.

‚Ä¢ If it's safe:

    ‚Ä¢ Place a queen ("Q").

    ‚Ä¢ Recurse to the next row.

    ‚Ä¢ After recursion (whether it succeeded or failed), backtrack by removing the queen (reset to ".") ‚Äî this is crucial to explore all configurations.

‚Ä¢ If you reach the base case r == n, it means a valid configuration is formed ‚Äî convert the board to a list of strings and add it to the results.

'''
For Solution 2 - Use a Hashset to store the queens placed in each row, column, left diagonal and right diagonal:
At any time:

‚Ä¢ colQueens ‚Üí contains the set of columns where a queen is already placed.

‚Ä¢ leftDiagonal ‚Üí contains the set of left diagonals (r - c) already occupied.

‚Ä¢rightDiagonal ‚Üí contains the set of right diagonals (r + c) already occupied.

üìå Why r-c and r+c?
‚Ä¢ In a matrix, cells on the same left diagonal have the same value of r - c.

‚Ä¢ Cells on the same right diagonal have the same value of r + c.
